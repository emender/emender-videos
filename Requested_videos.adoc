Emender videos
==============

*Two types of users:*

* _users_

** run emend, test their books, usually do not write tests

* _developers_

** write tests, libraries, integration with Jenkins + the same as users


*Topics for videos:*

* _introduction_

** what is Emender, why do we need it, what it can do for you, integration with Jenkins
** how do the tests look like
** demo

* _basic installation_

1. install all dependencies - git, lua
2. clone the Emender repo
3. install emender - make install
4. clone the repo with libraries (if needed)
5. install libs - make install
6. obtain tests (for example clone the repo with tests) and install their dependencies (xmlstarlet, xmllint)
7. test that this works - emend

* _how to use it?_

** command line interface - the emend command
** emend options - verbose, color, summary
** tests options - `--X<option>`
** play with outputs (html, plain text)

* _write your own tests_

** specification of test (test/, name include Test*.lua, naming conventions for files, how to define metadata,
** test methods: `setUp`, `tearDown`, test*
** test functions: pass, fail, warn, ..?
** helper functions :string.trim,
** debug mode?

* _continuous integration software, for example Jenkins (advanced)_
